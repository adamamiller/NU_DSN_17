# NU_DSN_17
Lecture on Developing a (Basic) Machine Learning Workflow

The easiest way to render and follow these slides is to have a working version of python and jupyter installed. A quick path towards this end is to install the [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) python package manager on your local machine. 

Then create a conda virtual environment with the following command: 

    conda create --name NU_DSN python=3.6 numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pandas
    
And once that is completed, activate the environment with:

    source activate NU_DSN
